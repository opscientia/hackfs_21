_"The transformative potential of IPFS for powering decentralized applications on Web 3.0 inspires me to consider how the internet can be made more inclusive, censorship-resistant, and empower the individual through self-sovereignty of personal data. I believe the decentralized web is approaching maturity for the widespread use and will soon transform various aspects of our life, making the world more open and at the same time upholding personal privacy!"_

### Alexandra McCarroll, Software & Data Engineer

_"Software engineer, data engineer, web3 evangelist, and experienced professional in traditional financial services both in London and Hong Kong. Currently exploring how we can make the world a fairer and freer place through the utilization of decentralized technologies, specifically data decentralization and data self-sovereignty."_

_"I personally believe that in fields like neuroscience, where extremely large datasets are becoming the norm, decentralized storage will prove a key factor in open and easy access to data and consequently help accelerate research."_

### Sarah Hamburg, Ph.D., Neuroscientist

<img src="./public/assets/Sarah.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

_"I spent my early life in academia before transitioning into tech. There‚Äôs an unnecessary gulf between the two which stifles innovation on both sides. I‚Äôm passionate about open and decentralised science to further knowledge generation, and participant involvement and empowerment."_

### Shady El Damaty, Ph.D., Neuroscientist

<img src="./public/assets/Shady.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:100px;"/>

_"The most significant existential challenge for the future of science is human coordination and incentive alignment. What started as a brain hack-a-thon project has become a start-up to decentralize scientific enterprise and uplift the people that make knowledge generation possible."_
